        The wheels of prophecy e'er turn<br />
        Gorion's ward has come.<br />
        Crossroads of past, present, and future<br />
        The one foretold, the one foreseen.<br />
      </p>
      <p>Wheels of Prophecy began as a fairly limited mod designed to give the   player the chance to register his/her distrust of a particular major   character in Throne of Bhaal (in case one or two people still don't know   who this is!) It grew into a project to add a bit of non-linearity to   the &quot;lead-em-by-the-nose&quot; 9th chapter of Throne of Bhaal, and to add a   bit of unfinished-business content along the way.</p>
      <p>If you hate Throne of Bhaal with a passion, this mod isn't for you.   If you have a soft spot for it, but feel it's flawed, this mod just   might give the last stage in the Bhaalspawn's journey a new lease of   life.</p>
      <p>For those who've played my other mods, a word of reassurance: Wheels   of Prophecy is not a tactical mod. It does introduce one or two new   combat encounters (depending on the route you take) but they're not   particularly difficult by the standards of Throne of Bhaal.    </p>

    <div class="section">
<p>Wheels of Prophecy is compatible with any of the four versions of   Throne of Bhaal: Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition, the Enhanced   Edition Trilogy mod, original Baldur's Gate II with the Throne of Bhaal   expansion, or the Baldur's Gate Trilogy mod. For either of the last two,   I highly recommend the <a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/bg2fixpack/">BG2 Fixpack</a>, available at G3 -   I wrote Wheels of Prophecy with the Fixpack installed, so I don't know   how well it will work without it.</p>
  <p>I wrote Wheels of Prophecy with the Ascension mod in mind, and I   recommend having Ascension installed (it's available at www.weidu.org);   install it early in your install order, and <strong>certainly</strong> before   Wheels of Prophecy. Ascension isn't required, though. If you don't   install Ascension, a small part of it (the part involving an alliance   with Balthazar) will be installed anyway (I didn't want to reinvent the   wheel by writing my own ally-with-Balthazar dialogue). I'm extremely   grateful to David Gaider, and to Cuv, for permission to reuse part of   Ascension.</p>
  <p>Wheels of Prophecy should be compatible with pretty much any other   mod that's out there, although given that it mucks around quite a lot   with the middle part of Throne of Bhaal, there's some prospect of it   interfering with NPCs' dialogues. In particular, it's fully compatible   with my tactical mod, Sword Coast Stratagems (SCS), provided that SCS is   installed <strong>after</strong> Wheels of Prophecy.</p>

      <p><strong>Enhanced Editions Note</strong><br />
        The Enhanced Editions are actively supported games. Please note that every   patch update will wipe your current mod setup! If in the middle of a   modded game you might want to delay the patch update (if possible) as   even after reinstalling the mods, you might not be able to continue with   your old savegames. Alternatively, copy the whole game's folder into a   new one that can be modded and will stay untouched by game patches. For BG2:EE it is important that you install the mod to the language   version you are playing the game in. Otherwise, the dialogues of the mod   will not show but give error messages. </p>
      <p><strong>Windows</strong><br />
        The Wheels of Prophecy for Windows is distributed as a self-extracting   archive and includes a WeiDU installer. To install, simply double-click   the archive and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, the files can be extracted into your game directory using <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7zip</a> or <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm">WinRAR</a>. When properly extracted, your game directory will contain <strong>setup-wheels.exe</strong> and the folder<strong> wheels</strong>. To install, double-click <strong>setup-wheels.exe</strong> and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
      <p>You can run <strong>setup-wheels.exe</strong> in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.</p>
      <p><strong>Mac OS X</strong><br />
        The Wheels of Prophecy  for Mac OS X is distributed as a compressed tarball and includes a WeiDU installer.</p>
      <p>First, extract the files from the tarball into your game directory. When properly extracted, your game directory will contain <strong>setup-wheels</strong>, <strong>setup-wheels.command</strong>, and the folder <strong>wheels</strong>. To install, double-click <strong>setup-wheels.command</strong> and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
      <p>You can run <strong>setup-wheels.command</strong> in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.</p>
      <p><strong>Linux</strong><br />
        The Wheels of Prophecy  for Linux is distributed as a compressed tarball and does not include a WeiDU installer.</p>
      <p>Extract the contents of the mod to the folder of the game you wish to modify.</p>
      <p>Download the latest version of WeiDU for Linux from <a href="http://www.weidu.org/%7Ethebigg/">WeiDU.org</a> and copy WeiDU and WeInstall to /usr/bin. Following that, open a terminal, cd to your game installation directory, run tolower   and answer Y to both queries. You can avoid running the second option   (linux.ini) if you've already ran it once in the same directory. To save   time, the archive is already tolowered, so there's no need to run the   first option (lowercasing file names) either if you've extracted only   this mod since the last time you lowercased file names. If you're   unsure, running tolower and choosing both options is the safe bet.</p>
      <p>To install, run WeInstall wheels in your game folder. Then run wine BGMain.exe and start playing. </p>
      <p><strong> Note for Complete Uninstallation</strong><br />
        In addition to the methods above for removing individual components, you can completely uninstall the mod using setup-wheels --uninstall at the command line to remove all components without wading through prompts. . </p>

<p>In summary, Wheels of Prophecy doesn't change the events of Throne of   Bhaal (not much, anyway), but it does allow the player to interact with   them in a much more flexible way. </p>
  <p>In more detail: the main change made is that the player can   attempt to enter Balthazar's monastery whenever s/he likes, instead of   waiting until after Sendai and Abazigal are dead. It's entirely up to   you what order you do it in. If you decide to wait until Abazigal and   Sendai are dead before confronting Balthazar, you won't notice much   change from the vanilla game; if you decide to encounter Balthazar   earlier, things may play out rather differently from what you remember.   (Getting into the monastery early in the game isn't completely trivial,   but it can be done (ask the smugglers, or slaughter your way in if   you're that way inclined). </p>
  <p> The mod also features: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Greatly expanded dialogue with Balthazar, Melissan, Sendai, Abazigal, and Elminster. </li>
    <li>Modifications to dialogue with Carras, Saemon, Faheed, Zahee, and the Solar. </li>
    <li>Minor unfinished-business content with the smugglers that didn't quite make it into Throne of Bhaal. </li>
    <li>Extra encounters part-way through dealing with the Five (depending which route you take) and just before confronting Melissan. </li>
    <li>An expanded conversation with the stone heads featuring voicing   cut from the released version of Throne of Bhaal, but unearthed   recently by K'aeloree of Spellhold Studios. </li>
    <li>And more! </li>
  </ul>
  <p> To get the most out of the mod, you should start a new game, or at least   start a new party at the start of Throne of Bhaal. Most of the new   content doesn't show up until you arrive at Amkethran, though, so any   save before then should be compatible. (You will, however, miss the   chance to tell Melissan where to go.) </p>
  <p> IF you're looking to see the most new content on a first playthrough, <strong>probably</strong> the best thing to do is to start with Balthazar's monastery.   Good-aligned parties may then have to beat a hasty retreat; more   bloodthirsty parties may have other ideas. </p>

<p> The modding community for the Infinity Engine has been going strong for          more than 15 years now, and is the culmination of thousands of unpaid modding          hours by fellow fans of the game. Modders produce their best work and players          get the best, well-supported mods when we all work together. </p>
  <p> There are two big ways to upset this harmony. One is to claim someone else's          work as your own. The second is to host and redistribute a mod without permission          from the author(s). </p>
  <p> Be kind to your fellow players and modders. Don't do either.    </p>
