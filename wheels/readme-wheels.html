<h1>The Wheels of Prophecy</h1>
<div class="section">
  <p><strong><a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/">A Gibberlings Three Mod</a> <br />
    Author: DavidW</strong></p>
  <p><strong> Version 3</strong></p>
</div>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="section">
<p>
<center>
The wheels of prophecy e'er turn<br>
Gorion's ward has come.<br>
Crossroads of past, present, and future<br>
The one foretold, the one foreseen.<br></center>

<p>Wheels of Prophecy began as a fairly limited mod designed to give the player the chance to register his/her distrust of a particular major character in Throne of Bhaal (in case one or two people still don't know who this is!) It grew into a project to add a bit of non-linearity to the "lead-em-by-the-nose" 9th chapter of Throne of Bhaal, and to add a bit of unfinished-business content along the way.</p>
<p>If you hate Throne of Bhaal with a passion, this mod isn't for you. If you have a soft spot for it, but feel it's flawed, this mod just might give the last stage in the Bhaalspawn's journey a new lease of life.</p>
<p>For those who've played my other mods, a word of reassurance: Wheels of Prophecy is not a tactical mod. It does introduce one or two new combat encounters (depending on the route you take) but they're not particularly difficult by the standards of Throne of Bhaal.
</div>
<h2>Compatibility</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>Wheels of Prophecy is compatible with any of the three versions of Throne of Bhaal: Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition, original Baldur's Gate II with the Throne of Bhaal expansion, or the Baldur's Gate Trilogy mod. For either of the last two, I highly recommend the BG2 Fixpack, available at www.gibberlings3.net - I wrote Wheels of Prophecy with the Fixpack installed, so I don't know how well it will work without it.</p>
<p>I wrote Wheels of Prophecy with the Ascension mod in mind, and I recommend having Ascension installed (it's available at www.weidu.org); install it early in your install order, and <b>certainly</b> before Wheels of Prophecy. Ascension isn't required, though. If you don't install Ascension, a small part of it (the part involving an alliance with Balthazar) will be installed anyway (I didn't want to reinvent the wheel by writing my own ally-with-Balthazar dialogue). I'm extremely grateful to David Gaider, and to Cuv, for permission to reuse part of Ascension.</p>
<p>Wheels of Prophecy should be compatible with pretty much any other mod that's out there, although given that it mucks around quite a lot with the middle part of Throne of Bhaal, there's some prospect of it interfering with NPCs' dialogues. In particular, it's fully compatible with my tactical mod, Sword Coast Stratagems (SCS), provided that SCS is installed <b>after</b> Wheels of Prophecy.</p>
</div>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p><strong>Windows</strong><br />
    Wheels of Prophecy is packaged and
    installed with <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> and
    is distributed as a self-extracting archive. To install, simply double-click
    the archive and follow the instructions on screen. </p>
  <p> Alternatively the files can be extracted from the archive using <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/">WinRAR</a>.
    If properly extracted, you should have a wheels folder
    and setup-wheels.exe in your <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> folder.
    To install, simply double-click setup-wheels.exe and follow the instructions
    on screen. </p>
  <p> Please run setup-wheels.exe in your <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> folder
    to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components. </p>
  <p> <strong>Mac OS X</strong><br />
    If the mod was previously installed, uninstall it before extracting the
    new version. Wheels of Prophecy
    is packaged and installed with <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym>.
    To install, simply extract the contents of the mod into your <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> folder.&nbsp;If
    properly extracted, you should have a wheels folder, setup-wheels, and setup-wheels.command in your <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> folder.
    To install, simply double-click <strong>setup-wheels.command</strong> and
    follow the instructions on screen. </p>
<p>In any case, Wheels of Prophecy should be installed fairly early in your installation order (before NPC mods, tweaks, and tactical mods) but after any Fixpack, and after Ascension.
</div>
<h2>Contents</h2>
<div class="section">
<p>In summary, Wheels of Prophecy doesn't change the events of Throne of Bhaal (not much, anyway), but it does allow the player to interact with them in a much more flexible way.
<p>In more detail: the main change made is that the player can attempt to enter Balthazar's monastery whenever s/he likes, instead of waiting until after Sendai and Abazigal are dead. It's entirely up to you what order you do it in. If you decide to wait until Abazigal and Sendai are dead before confronting Balthazar, you won't notice much change from the vanilla game; if you decide to encounter Balthazar earlier, things may play out rather differently from what you remember. (Getting into the monastery early in the game isn't completely trivial, but it can be done (ask the smugglers, or slaughter your way in if you're that way inclined).
<p>
The mod also features:
<ul>
<li>Greatly expanded dialogue with Balthazar, Melissan, Sendai, Abazigal, and Elminster.
<li>Modifications to dialogue with Carras, Saemon, Faheed, Zahee, and the Solar.
<li>Minor unfinished-business content with the smugglers that didn't quite make it into Throne of Bhaal.
<li>Extra encounters part-way through dealing with the Five (depending which route you take) and just before confronting Melissan.
<li>An expanded conversation with the stone heads featuring voicing cut from the released version of Throne of Bhaal, but unearthed recently by K'aeloree of Spellhold Studios.
<li>And more!
</ul>
<p>
To get the most out of the mod, you should start a new game, or at least start a new party at the start of Throne of Bhaal. Most of the new content doesn't show up until you arrive at Amkethran, though, so any save before then should be compatible. (You will, however, miss the chance to tell Melissan where to go.) 
<p>
IF you're looking to see the most new content on a first playthrough, <b>probably</b> the best thing to do is to start with Balthazar's monastery. Good-aligned parties may then have to beat a hasty retreat; more bloodthirsty parties may have other ideas.
