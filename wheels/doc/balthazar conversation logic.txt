Make this a logic tree. 1 and 7 are special and handled by weight.
CONFIRMED THESE ARE MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE EXCEPT 1/7
1, 7 are self-killing: they anull their allowance variable & so fire once only

both A/S alive, monks non-hostile, first time breaking in, bal hp>1?
Y: 3
both A/S alive, monks non-hostile, not first time breaking in, bal hp>1?
Y: 11
both A/S alive, monks hostile, bal hp>1?
Y: 12
both A/S alive, bal hp=1?
Y: 5
had dream2 but not dream3, mel alive?
Y: 8
had dream2 but not dream3, mel dead?
Y: 2var
had dream3, one of Abaz/Send alive, DMWWBvMEnd not 2?
Y: 4
had dream3, both Abaz and Sendai dead, mel alive, DMWWBvMEnd not 2?
Y: 2
DMWWBvEnd=2?
Y: 10
Abaz, Sendai, Mel all dead, not yet had dream 5, have had dream 3?
Y: 9
Had dream 5?
Y: 6


Break these down by dream status

!dream2 [phase 1]

3, 5, new

dream2, !dream3 [phase 2]

2var, 8

dream3, !dream5 [phase 3]

2, 4, 9, 10

dream5 [finale]

6
