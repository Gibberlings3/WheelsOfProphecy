VARIABLES relevant to village attack

Enclave

Enclave=1 is irrelevant and unused
Enclave=2 indicates that the enclave (monks and mercenaries) are hostile. 
It is set by:
- the death of Abazigal or Sendai at the end of phase 2 
- DMWWMercStatus=4
It is never unset

DMWWVillageAttacked

DMWWVillageAttacked=1 if the village is currently under attack by the forces of Abazigal/Sendai
DMWWVillageAttacked=2 if the attack is over

Set to 1:
- by the panicked peasants created on entering the village at the end of Phase 2 (but before dream 3) if either Abazigal or Sendai is alive
- by the monk who talks to Balthazar after you get him on side at the end of Phase 2

DMWWMercStatus

0: default
1: not used nor set
2: Village under attack, Balthazar not dead
3: Mercenaries are leaving village following successful defeat of Abaz/Sendai's army
4: Mercenaries are hostile

Set to 4:
- if any mercenary is attacked
- if any mercenary has allegiance Enemy
- if Sendai is dead, Abazigal is dead, Balth is alive, and Balth has not joined (i.e., entering the village after defeating S/Ab in the standard order)

Set to 3:
- by the conversation with the merc leader after the end of the battle

Set to 2:
- if the village is attacked and Balthazar is not dead (i.e., on side)

AmMercEnemy

1: Mercs have been attacked

Used to keep track of whether mercs have been attacked. Only used by ammerc.bcs

AmMonkEnemy: ditto for monks (used in ammgrd and ar5500)



SCRIPT

If smuggler status is odd, advance it by 1

If DMWWMercStatus is 4, set Enclave to 2

ONCE: If Abaz is dead, Send is *not* dead, and Balth is either dead or joined (i.e., if we've just finished phase 2 and Sendai is alive) darken the village

ONCE: If we've just finished phase 2, and one of Abaz and Sendai is alive, create dw#ampp[1-3], and set an 8-second timer DMWWAttackTimer, and set DMWWAttackInitialise to 1 

ONCE: Once the timer has expired, set DMWWVillageAttack=1

ONCE: If party has the Monastery Key PLOT17A, set SaemonLeave=1

ONCE: If Balthazar is *not* dead and the village is attacked, set DMWWMercStatus=2, and set a 12-second timer DW#VillageReinforce

If the DW#VillageReinforce timer is expired 
?? ++ and DW#ReinforceInitialise=2
and Balth is alive and DMWWMercStatus<4, create a bunch of mercs and monks and set the timer back to 12
(i.e. do that every 2 rounds)

If DMWWVillageAttacked=1 and we've had <30 attackers type 1 attackers (DW#Attacker1cap) and if EXTRACOUNT6<5, and if Sendai is alive, increment the counts 1 and summon a drow or derro

vice versa version for Abazigal

Similarly for higher-power reinforcements [bug in number increment?]

If DMWWVillageAttacked=1, and Balth, Sendai both live, and if we've gone over the two caps, and if mercstatus<4, and if the combat counter is 0, spawn dw#vime1 and two flunkies and set DMWWVillageAttacked=2

Vice versa for Abazigal

If Balth is dead, single block (??) to turn off attackers and set DMWWVillageAttacked=2 a la the above

ONCE: Open the monastery door if either Balth is dead or he's joined the fight

ONCE: If SaemonDisguise<2, and if either ammgrd01 or ammgrd04 is at <50% hp, spawn cutammag x2, cutamfig x2

If Balth is dead, and it's daytime, and Enclave>=2, spawn random background NPCs

ONCE: OnCreation, is Balth is dead, and Enclave=2, and either AmkMercCap or AmkMonkCap>0, set both to zero

ONCE: Start chapter 9

ONCE: If you've talked to Marlowe, add an appropriate map note for his house

ONCE: If Enclave=2, spawn the guard with the key

ONCE: If Enclave<2, and a timer has expired, spawn the Omar/Asana cs 

ONCE: If Enclave<2, spawn the Monk/Priest. [will happen immediately upon entering for the first time.]

ONCE: Spawn the Saemon CS

If MONKSPAWNEDSMUGGLERPLOT=1, set it to 2

ONCE: If door08 is open and door01 isn't, open door01.

ONCE: If the guard on the gravecave is dead and party have taken Marlowe's quest, open the cave

ONCE: If Enclave=2, open the gravecave

If Enclave<2, and the village isn't under attack, and it's daytime, spawn random ambients

Bunch of spawn scripts to spawn merc and the like if it's daytime, DMWWVillageAttacked isn't 1, and Enclave isn't 2.
Plus one script to spawn monks that also checks AmMonkEnemy.

If Enclave=2, and Balth isn't dead,and we haven't had a total of 25 mercs, and not too many are on screen, spawn one.
Ditto monks.
