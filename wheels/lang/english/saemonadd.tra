@0    = ~And I'm guessing you've got a wish to reach Balthazar too. In that case, you've got to get inside the monastery.  And I've got a couple of ideas which might enable you to do that.  Interested?~
@1    = ~I have no quarrel with Balthazar.~
@2    = ~I have other business for now.~
@3    = ~Well, it's your decision, <CHARNAME>. But should you change your mind - and I rather feel you might before too long - you'll know where to find me.~
@4    = ~<CHARNAME>, so nice to see you again. I take it you've reconsidered my offer to get you into the monastery, then?~
@5    = ~Ah... well, to be truthful with you, <CHARNAME>, there isn't really any other way... not since the wards on the graveyard passage were strengthened. I'm afraid the disguise plan is all I can suggest.~
@6    = ~I am sorry that you have such mistrust in me, <CHARNAME>! But now that the wards on the graveyard passage have been strengthened, there really isn't any other way in.~
