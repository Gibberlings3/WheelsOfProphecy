@1    = ~They say Balthazar is dead... what this means for the village I don't know, but the mercenaries have withdrawn for the moment.~

@4    = ~Abazigal's army will return before long. The village is doomed - whether the mercenaries or the dragon-kin emerge triumphant, none of us will survive. May the gods protect us!~
@5    = ~Did you see Balthazar's battle? Alone against a red dragon, and he threw its body down from the high peak! Whatever people say about him, he is the true defender of this village!~
@6    = ~Did you see Balthazar's battle? Alone against a horde of drow spellweavers, and he threw them down from the high peak! Whatever people say about him, he is the true defender of this village!~
@7    = ~A beholder burst into the temple of Waukeen - did you hear? The priests slew it, but the casualties were awful. The gods have forsaken us!~
@8    = ~Did you see the eyes? Awful, they were - huge, and throwing enchantments everywhere. How can mere men fight things like that?~
